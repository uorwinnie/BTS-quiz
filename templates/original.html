          <strong>BTS </strong>, also known as Bangtan Boys, or 방탄소년단, is a
          seven-member musical act from South Korea. The group was established
          under the management of BigHit Music (now under HYBE Corporation), a
          South Korean entertainment company founded by songwriter and producer
          Bang Shi Hyuk. Despite the company's initial setbacks and limited
          resources, BigHit believed in their motto, “music and artist for
          healing,” and fostered an environment that allowed artists to develop
          their talents and to advance on their own authority. The members of
          BTS include Kim Namjoon (the leader), Kim Seokjin, Min Yoongi, Jung
          Hoseok, Park Jimin, Kim Taehyung, and Jeon Jungkook. More officially,
          each member is referred to by his stage name (in the same order): RM,
          Jin, Suga, J-hope, Jimin, V, and Jungkook.

            If you go to google and search "BTS", you will see a purple
            heart-shaped balloon with a microphone in it. Touch it, there is a
            voice message from BTS members. You can just click this purple heart
